/* Phonebook where the contacts are objects that hold  a name and a treemap (with #type and #) held in an ArrayList.
-lookup [for loop]
-add is already there for arrayList and put for TreeMap. Use noKeyRepeat() for multiple phoneNumber types in map, sets
PhoneNumber key to phone# and adds a number at the end of keyname (1-3)
-simple remove() by key
-print by contacts by sorting & looping through array, print by phone numbers by sorting by values then two loops
in order to do collection view of map
-reverse lookup- two for loops to go through the array, then through the treemap to find
-remove record by looping through arraylist and finding, then removing contact
