/**
 * Part 1:
 Create a class called Row. Each instance of Row should have a unique id number, starting at 1,
 which can be read with a getter called getId but cannot be changed after the instance is created.
 Part 2:
 A row that stores no data is not very useful in a database.
 Add getAttribute and setAttribute methods that allow the user to view and modify the attributes in the row
 (by providing the name of the attribute they wish to view or modify).
 You may have to change other parts of your class in order to achieve this.
